Description: Alternating least squares is often used to resolve
        components contributing to data with a bilinear structure; the
        basic technique may be extended to alternating constrained
        least squares.  Commonly applied constraints include
        unimodality, non-negativity, and normalization of components.
        Several data matrices may be decomposed simultaneously by
        assuming that one of the two matrices in the bilinear
        decomposition is shared between datasets.
